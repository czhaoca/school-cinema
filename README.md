# National Elementary School IT Contest 2005 - School Cinema Website Archive
Last edit: Mar 29, 2005

This repository is a time capsule for the website created as an entry for the National IT Contest in 2005. The site served as a vibrant introduction to our school's cinema program, showcasing our history, achievements, and various artworks contributed by the students.

## Overview

In its prime, the website was a digital gateway to our school's budding cinema scene, complete with animated features and interactive content, all made possible with Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash. The ribbons across the website acted as a narrative path, guiding visitors through pages filled with our cinema's history and student creativity.

## Purpose of the Archive

As the modern web has phased out support for Flash, this repository does not aim to provide a fully functional website in today's browsing environment. Instead, it exists for historical reference, to inspire educational pursuits and to safeguard the digital artifacts of our collective school memory.

## Copyright and Permissions

The original designs, animations, and artworks are copyrighted material held by the authors and contributors of the website. These works are published here for non-commercial, educational purposes only, and may not be used without explicit permission from the copyright holders.


## Running the Archive

Due to the retirement of Flash support in contemporary browsers, viewing the website as originally intended may require a specialized setup. For educational purposes or to begin the process of modernizing the content, see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for instructions on how to run the website locally with legacy technology support.

## Development Heritage

This website was more than just a contest entry; it was a digital canvas that allowed us to immortalize our early steps into the world of multimedia and web design. Through Dreamweaver and Flash, we brought to life the following aspects:

- **School Cinema Introduction**: An interactive tour through the inception and vision of our school cinema program.
- **History and Milestones**: A timeline detailing significant events and achievements of our cinema's journey.
- **Student Artwork Display**: A gallery featuring creative contributions from students, highlighting the artistic talent within our school community.

## Modernization Initiative

The passage of time has rendered the technology behind this website obsolete, yet the spirit of innovation and education remains timeless. We welcome developers, designers, and educators who are interested in preserving this digital artifact by helping to convert and modernize it to current web standards.

If you wish to participate in this endeavor, please DM for more information on how you can contribute.
